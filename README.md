## You start with owning one circle, to send half of your units to another cirlce, click the source circle and then the destination circle. If you want to send all of your units in that one circle, then hold control. Circles gain one unit per second when they are owned. If you send units to opposing circles, it will decrease the amount of units on that circle based on the number of units sent. Once you decrease a circles unit count to zero gain control of the circle. To win, gain control of all circles. Have fun expanding!
